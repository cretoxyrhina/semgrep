Matching: Numeric capture group metavariables of the form $1, $2, etc that are
introduced by unnamed capture groups, now no longer will cause matches to fail
if they do not unify. They are still referenceable, however.

This is so that capture group metavariables (which are introduced rather implicitly)
do not cause rules to "invisibly" fail to match.
